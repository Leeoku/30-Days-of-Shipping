#30 Days of Shipping

**Start date**: June 1 2020

**End date**: June 30 2020

## Goals

* Complete Dota Discord Bot Goals
* Contribute to Summer of Shipping Open Source Project(s)
* Learn about databases and implement into project(s)
* Create a personal site

## Day 1

* Project you are working on: https://github.com/Leeoku/DotaBot
     1. A Dota Discord Bot with the goal of returning wiki links using !hero. Also create a mini profile where users can create a small profile using !myprofile
* Progress today: 
     1. Minimized scope in my project by reducing the number of functions to just !hero and the components for !myprofile. 
     2. !addhero was added today 
* Challenges you faced: 
	 1. I had trouble deciding on whether I wanted to keep my stored data in the JSON file or work to upload it directly to MongoDB. Even though I had some help from a different mentor, it was a pain to set up. Decided to stick with Mongo as the cloud storage database would be useful for future.
* Tasks for tomorrow
	 1. Work on !deregister and !delhero
	 2. Learn more MongoDB
