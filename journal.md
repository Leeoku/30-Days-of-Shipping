#30 Days of Shipping

**Start date**: June 1 2020

**End date**: June 30 2020

## Goals

* Complete Dota Discord Bot Goals
* Contribute to Summer of Shipping Open Source Project(s)
* Learn about databases and implement into project(s)
* Create a personal site

## Day 1

* ### Project you are working on: 
     1.   A [Dota Discord Bot](https://github.com/Leeoku/DotaBot) with the goal of returning wiki links using !hero. Also create a mini profile where users can create a small profile using !myprofile
* ### Progress today: 
     1.   Minimized scope in my project by reducing the number of functions to just !hero and the components for !myprofile. 
     2.   !addhero was added today 
* ### Challenges you faced: 
     1.   I had trouble deciding on whether I wanted to keep my stored data in the JSON file or work to upload it directly to MongoDB. Even though I had some help from a different mentor, it was a pain to set up. Decided to stick with Mongo as the cloud storage database would be useful for future.
* Tasks for tomorrow
     1.   Work on !deregister and !delhero
     2.   Learn more MongoDB

## Day 2

* ### Project you are working on: 
     1.   [Dota Discord Bot](https://github.com/Leeoku/DotaBot)
     2.   [Summer of Shipping (SoS): Product Engineer for Mentor Matchmaking](https://github.com/phil-ociraptor/sos-landing)
* ### Progress today: 
     1.   Fixed bugs on !addhero
     2.   !delhero was added today (partial)
* ### Challenges you faced: 
     1.   While working on !deregister, realized I never tested specific cases for !addhero. So fixed them as I went along
     2.   Learned about string manipulation and how it was important to keep things consistent (lowercase vs titled etc). I decided to lowercase everything
          for comparisons of my data while titling all the results for profile information
     3.   In Summer of Shipping, my mentor Phil taught us about adding `remote upstream`. This was a new concept combined with `git rebase`. I had some troubles
          with this but realized after numerous tries the errors occurred because I didn't fork it initially. Now I know.
* ### Tasks for tomorrow
     1.   Work on !deregister and !delhero
     2.   Learn more MongoDB
     3.   Want to start highlighting some ideas from Phil's orientation document

## Day 3

* ### Project you are working on: 
     1.   [Dota Discord Bot](https://github.com/Leeoku/DotaBot)
     2.   [Summer of Shipping (SoS): Product Engineer for Mentor Matchmaking](https://github.com/phil-ociraptor/sos-landing)
* ### Progress today: 
     1.   Dota Discord Bot: Fixed bugs on !addhero; Completed !delhero and !deregister
     2.   SoS: Initial attempt at defininig and understanding the problem answering initial questions from mentor.
* ### Challenges you faced: 
     1.   MongoDB was more confusing than expected. The documentation is not what I'm used to and the number of resources seemed less. However some simple vids helped me through it. Need to learn to read the docs better!
     2.   Testing my DotaBot seemed to go smoothly until I asked some friends to demo it. They found way more bugs than the case scenarios I expected. Need to think more outside the box and expand testing.
     3.   Defining the problem statement for Mentorship Matchmaking was difficult. It is a complex, multi-layered problem at glance. I'll try to break down the problem more, ask mentor for more insight and definitely ask the users.
* ### Tasks for tomorrow
     1.   Polish up DotaBot for showcase tomorrow.
     2.   Learn more MongoDB
     3.   Work on the problem statement again for SoS

## Day 4

* ### Project you are working on: 
     1.   [Dota Discord Bot](https://github.com/Leeoku/DotaBot)
     2.   [Summer of Shipping (SoS): Product Engineer for Mentor Matchmaking](https://github.com/phil-ociraptor/sos-landing)
* ### Progress today: 
     1.   Dota Discord Bot: Fixed bugs on !addhero to make it include exact matches only
     2.   Presented DotaBot to SoS community
     3.   Did research on mentor matchmaking
* ### Challenges you faced: 
     1.   While getting help to fix an issue with a bug in my code, the person helping        me on Python Discord Help may have been frustrated with me. I understood what       I wanted my code to do, I thought my code did it and my brain couldn't wrap         around what was wrong. He was patient and we went through all the details and       parts of my code breaking it down. I was frustrated I couldn't find it.

          In the end, I solved it. Turns out the computer is only as smart as yourself. I had an incorrect operator which was right in front of me. Maybe it was a reading issue, an understanding of what each word in my code did or my bad habit of being unable to think outside the box/differently.

          What I learned was taking a break and coming back helped. I understand why people like rubber duckies now.
* ### Tasks for tomorrow
     1.   Start on the SoS Python Project (recipe app idea)
     2.   Submit the SoS Mentor Sheet/schedule time with Phil
     3.   Put final touches on DotaBot Github (super low priority, project is basically done)

## Day 5

* ### Project you are working on: 
     1.   [Dota Discord Bot](https://github.com/Leeoku/DotaBot)
     2.   [Summer of Shipping (SoS): Product Engineer for Mentor Matchmaking](https://github.com/phil-ociraptor/sos-landing)
* ### Progress today: 
     1.   Dota Discord Bot: Add README and closing up project
     2.   Did research on mentor matchmaking
* ### Challenges you faced: 
     After going through research, I found there is no clear way of matchmaking effectively. The compromise of time vs effective matching is the tradeoff. Even Phil spent 3 hours manually searching up and using his best judgement in new groups.

     I think the best way is to effectively highlight some key indicators in terms of skill, general experience and language preference is the best way.

     Also talked to a few mentors. They really like teaching / helping in their free time. This is why I like the software community

* ### Tasks for tomorrow
     1.   Start on the SoS Python Project (recipe app idea)
     2.   Connect with Phil hopefully
     3.   Going to try next.js tomorrow 

## Day 6

* ### Project you are working on: 
     1.   [Summer of Shipping (SoS): Product Engineer for Mentor Matchmaking](https://github.com/phil-ociraptor/sos-landing)
* ### Progress today: 
     1.   Got some feedback and reflected on how to write better for SoS
* ### Challenges you faced: 
     Mentor liked the info in there but I guess wasn't clear in his instructions. Still the content is good and need to polish things up.

* ### Tasks for tomorrow
     1.   Review the doc for SoS
     2.   Going to try next.js tomorrow 

## Day 7

* ### Project you are working on: 
     1.   [Summer of Shipping (SoS): Product Engineer for Mentor Matchmaking](https://github.com/phil-ociraptor/sos-landing)
* ### Progress today: 
     1.   Mostly nextjs tutorial
* ### Challenges you faced: 
     Sometimes following a tutorial is super hard. Some silly typo, copying and pasting multiple times just to get it to work...

* ### Tasks for tomorrow
     1.   Review the doc for SoS
     2.   Going to try next.js tomorrow 

## Day 8

* ### Project you are working on: 
     1.   [Summer of Shipping (SoS): Product Engineer for Mentor Matchmaking](https://github.com/phil-ociraptor/sos-landing)
     2.   [StockedUp/Pearish](https://github.com/Leeoku/StockedUp)
* ### Progress today: 
     1.   Mostly nextjs tutorial
     2.   Led Python team meeting for Tyler's idea on StockedUp/Perish, a web app to scan receipts and store their expiry dates
* ### Challenges you faced: 
     Kept grinding at NextJS tutorial. Really lost, maybe cause I have a weak React base. Will definitely go back afterwards.

     Also led a meeting and found it hard to get engagement. Maybe I talk a lot or others were too shy. In the end, I did lay decisions, set up a gameplan and got the ball rolling, so that's a plus!

* ### Tasks for tomorrow
     1.   Review the doc for SoS
     2.   Try to finish next.js tutorial
     3.   Start learning Pytessract/OpenCV

## Day 8

* ### Project you are working on: 
     1.   [Summer of Shipping (SoS): Product Engineer for Mentor Matchmaking](https://github.com/phil-ociraptor/sos-landing)
     2.   [StockedUp/Pearish](https://github.com/Leeoku/StockedUp)
* ### Progress today: 
     1.   Clarified the design statement for Mentorship SoS
     2.   Interviewed some mentors and had project feedback
* ### Challenges you faced: 
     The SoS Mentorship problem is very complex. It is social logistics plus  management issues. Not really sure what the coded solution would be but did try to condense a lot.

* ### Tasks for tomorrow
     1.   Review the doc for SoS
     2.   Start learning Pytessract/OpenCV

## Day 10

* ### Project you are working on: 
     1.   [Summer of Shipping (SoS): Product Engineer for Mentor Matchmaking](https://github.com/phil-ociraptor/sos-landing)
     2.   [StockedUp/Pearish](https://github.com/Leeoku/StockedUp)
* ### Progress today: 
     1.   Completed the SoS Revision
     2.   Discussed the current status/issues with SoS Project Manager Gary
* ### Challenges you faced: 
     It's hard to explain things after you worked on something for some time to a new person. I hope I didn't overwhelm Gary.

     Reflected on some mentor advice for the project. I did outline my project plan and they had the same concerns I had. Some solutions were proposed that helped steer the project in the right direction, but others were a personal choice. Will see what group says.

* ### Tasks for tomorrow
     1.   Try to parse the text for receipts
     2.   Ask Gary for feedback on SoS Mentorship

## Day 11

* ### Project you are working on: 
     1.   [Summer of Shipping (SoS): Product Engineer for Mentor Matchmaking](https://github.com/phil-ociraptor/sos-landing)
     2.   [StockedUp/Pearish](https://github.com/Leeoku/StockedUp)
* ### Progress today: 
     1.   Problem definition with SoS Mentorship
     2.   Familiarized with OCR.Space Python Wrapper
* ### Challenges you faced: 
     Explaining to mentor Phil our current state of matchmaking was productive. What was difficult is the magnitude of this complex issue. What helped was narrowing it to a specific audience and finding the best way to solve that one problem.

* ### Tasks for tomorrow
     1.   Try to parse the text for receipts
     2.   Start on SoS Docs
